\section{Implementation \& Integration}
\label{sec: implementation}%
As showed in the deployment diagram, there relations between services that should be considered for the definition of
the order of implementation of the modules.
We suppose that DBMS are already deployed systems that will be used by our components.
It follows a list of a possible path for the implementation.
Each step lists modules that can be deployed in parallel.
The order is defined by the dependencies between components.
It is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We start with the modules that directly communicate with DBMSs. They are: Registration Service,
    EVD Authentication Service, EVD Profile Manager Service, Explore Stations Service, Calendar Service, CPO Authentication Service,
    CPO Profile Manager Service, Charging Stations Manager Service.
    \item The implementation should continue with modules that allow communication with external services.
    They are: Payment Service, Charging Station Communication Service, DSO Manager Service.
    \item Now it is the turn of components that have strong relations with previous implemented service, as:
    Promotion Service, Booking Service and Charging Session Service.
    \item Finally, it has to be implemented the module that communicates with the greater number of services: Suggestion Service.
    In this final step, it should be completed the process for the asynchronous call started by Calendar Service
    after the addition of a new activity.
\end{itemize}
