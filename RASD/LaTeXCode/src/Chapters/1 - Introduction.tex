The EVs are eco-friendly vehicles that will be on our roads in the next future.
In order to keep global warming below 1.5Â°C, Europe have decided to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of CO2 per
person per year by 2030, and, by the same year, the IEA predicts that electric vehicles will have a market share
of roughly 30 percent, with a total number of 23 million e-cars on the roads.
EVs consumption is measured in kilowatt-hours per 100 kilometers, and most of the current electric cars can travel
between 150 and 350 kilometers on a single charge, but premium-brand models can currently cover more than 500
kilometers.

%Batteries used in EVs makes the car in order to have a longer life service than the fuel cars, and they are to be
%used in future to stabilize smart grids, which denotes intelligent electricity networks.
%In particular, they perfectly coordinate the generation, the storage and the consumption of electricity and
%equalizes power fluctuations in the grid.

%The batteries are the main problem of electromobility, for instance, the users asks for batteries that allows
%them to drive for long distances, and at low costs.

In this context, when people use an electric vehicle, knowing where to charge it and carefully planning the
charging process in such a way that it introduces minimal interference and constraints on our daily schedule
is of great importance.

That's were \verb|eMALL| operates: it can find charging stations owned by several Charging Point Operators (CPO) and,
considering the activities in user's schedule, it can propose the best possible path of charging process
in order to minimize the cost and the waisted time at the station.

%In this setting a software that allows people to choose for the best Charging Point Operator, e.g.\ CPO
